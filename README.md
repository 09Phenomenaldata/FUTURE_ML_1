# FUTURE_ML_1

📊 Task 1: AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard
Project completed as part of the Future Interns Machine Learning Internship

📌 Objective
Build a machine learning model to forecast future retail sales using historical time series data.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Python

Facebook Prophet – for time series forecasting

Matplotlib – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for model evaluation (MAE)

Google Colab – development environment

📈 Features

🔮 Time series forecasting using Prophet

📊 Decomposition of trend and seasonality

📉 Evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

📍 Comparison of actual vs predicted sales over the last 30 days

📷 Visual dashboard with plots for trends and predictions

📊 Output

60-day forecast of synthetic retail sales

Performance Metric:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) – indicates forecast accuracy

Visual Output:

Sales trend graph

Prophet forecast plot

Trend & seasonality components

Actual vs predicted sales comparison
